Today marks the birthday of **mv-web.net**.
I wanted to take a moment to write down a few thoughts for myself and keep a record of this journey.

This space will serve as a personal corner where I can share and reflect on the things that matter to me â€” whether itâ€™s programming experiments, progress on my **home server project**, my passion for **motorcycling**, or stories from **traveling**.

I donâ€™t know yet where this blog will go, but thatâ€™s part of the fun. ðŸš€
